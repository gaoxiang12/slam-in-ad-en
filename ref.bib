  abstract  = {Abstract This work proposes a system for long-term mapping and localization based on the Feature Stability Histogram (FSH) model which is an innovative feature management approach able to cope with changing environments. \{FSH\} is built using a voting schema, where re-observed features are promoted; otherwise the feature progressively decreases its corresponding \{FSH\} value. \{FSH\} is inspired by the human memory model. This model introduces concepts of Short-Term Memory (STM), which retains information long enough to use it, and Long-Term Memory (LTM), which retains information for longer periods of time. If the entries in \{STM\} are continuously rehearsed, they become part of LTM. However, this work proposes a change in the pipeline of this model, allowing any feature to be part of \{STM\} or \{LTM\} depending on the feature strength. \{FSH\} stores the stability values of local features, stable features are only used for localization and mapping. Experimental validation of the \{FSH\} model was conducted using the FastSLAM framework and a long-term dataset collected during a period of one year at different environmental conditions. The experiments carried out include qualitative and quantitative results such as: filtering out dynamic objects, increasing map accuracy, scalability, and reducing the data association effort in long-term runs.},

  abstract  = {Theano is a compiler for mathematical expressions in Python that combines the convenience of NumPyâ€™s syntax with the speed of optimized native machine language. The user composes mathematical expressions in a high-level description that mimics NumPyâ€™s syntax and semantics, while being statically typed and functional (as opposed to imperative). These expressions allow Theano to provide symbolic differentiation. Before performing computation, Theano optimizes the choice of expressions, translates them into C++ (or CUDA for GPU), compiles them into dynamically loaded Python modules, all automatically. Common machine learning algorithms implemented with Theano are from 1.6Ã�???????????? to 7.5Ã�???????????? faster than competitive alternatives (including those implemented with C/C++, NumPy/SciPy and MATLAB) when compiled for the CPU and between 6.5Ã�???????????? and 44Ã�???????????? faster when compiled for the GPU. This paper illustrates how to use Theano, outlines the scope of the compiler, provides benchmarks on both CPU and GPU processors, and explains its overall design.},

  Abstract                 = {For the last three years, we have developed and researched multiple collaborative robots, CoBots, which have been autonomously traversing our multi-floor buildings. We pursue the goal of long-term autonomy for indoor service mobile robots as the ability for them to be deployed indefinitely while they perform tasks in an evolving environment. The CoBots include several levels of autonomy, and in this paper we focus on their localization and navigation algorithms. We present the Corrective Gradient Refinement (CGR) algorithm, which refines the proposal distribution of the particle filter used for localization with sensor observations using analytically computed state space derivatives on a vector map. We also present the Fast Sampling Plane Filtering algorithm that extracts planar regions from depth images in real time. These planar regions are then projected onto the 2D vector map of the building, and along with the laser rangefinder observations, used with CGR for localization. For navigation, we present a hierarchical planner, which computes a topological policy using a graph representation of the environment, computes motion commands based on the topological policy, and then modifies the motion commands to side-step perceived obstacles. We started logging the deployments of the CoBots one and a half years ago, and have since collected logs of the CoBots traversing more than 130 km over 1082 deployments and a total run time of 182 h, which we publish as a dataset consisting of more than 10 million laser scans. The logs show that although there have been continuous changes in the environment, the robots are robust to most of them, and there exist only a few locations where changes in the environment cause increased uncertainty in localization.},

Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is currently regarded as a viable solution for this problem. As the traditional metric approach to SLAM is experiencing computational difficulties when exploring large areas, increasing attention is being paid to topological SLAM, which is bound to provide sufficiently accurate location estimates, while being significantly less computationally demanding. This paper intends to provide an introductory overview of the most prominent techniques that have been applied to topological SLAM in terms of feature detection, map matching, and map fusion.},

  abstract       = {The semantic mapping of the environment requires simultaneous segmentation and categorization of the acquired stream of sensory information. The existing methods typically consider the semantic mapping as the final goal and differ in the number and types of considered semantic categories. We envision semantic understanding of the environment as an on-going process and seek representations which can be refined and adapted depending on the task and robot’s interaction with the environment. In this work we propose a novel and efficient method for semantic parsing, which can be adapted to the task at hand and enables localization of objects of interest in indoor environments. For basic mobility tasks we demonstrate how to obtain initial semantic segmentation of the scene into ground, structure, furniture and props categories which constitute the first level of hierarchy. Then, we propose a simple and efficient method for predicting locations of objects that based on their size afford a manipulation task. In our experiments we use the publicly available NYU V2 dataset and obtain better or comparable results than the state of the art at a fraction of the computational cost. We show the generalization of our approach on two more publicly available datasets.},
  comment        = {cadena出品，必属精品系列。 思路是先把地图用super pixel，弄出一个生成树。然后对每一个super pixel，提取一共十五维的特征，包括外观，3D信息，用它们来分类。 事实上语义地图就是个分割-分类的问题，难点是要做到实时，并且类别设置要妥当。 本文的类别是四分类：ground, structure, furniture, props. 也就是所有的super pixel都属于这四类之一。 对于不同的任务，其对于地图的认识层次需求也是不用的。机器人只需感知有兴趣的物体，不用识别环境里所有乱七八糟的东西。 文章有代码：www.di.ens.fr/~mschmidt/Software/UGM.html dataset: NYU V2 2015.6 仔仔细细地读了一遍，代码也跑通了，虽然未细看。 核心是用CRF表示类别的分布，并推理出每个物体的标签。 流程：super pixel seg. -> image & 3d features ->graph structure -> compute potentials of CRF -> inference. 对一张普通的图需要计算20秒左右。可能是因为matlab本身慢。最花时间的是3D特征的计算，尽管论文里认为是entropy。 优点：CRF可以推理出很复杂的结构。灵活性好。 缺点：仅能对单张图进行表示，计算量仍然很大（尽管树结构能简化图的表达），整体算法较复杂。需要事先训练分类器。语义方面只有四个类别，比较单一。 最直观的应用是直接丢进SLAM里计算，这样能得到一张semantic map，真正的语义地图，虽然语义比较简单。这个在Zhao2014中已经做过了。},

Multisensor fusion is performed at the level of landmarks, which represent sets of related and possibly correlated sensor observations. The work emphasizes the idea of partial redundancy due to the different nature of the information provided by different sensors. Experimentation with a mobile robot equipped with a multisensor system composed of a 2-D laser rangefinder and a charge coupled device camera is reported.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is about long-term navigation in environments whose appearance changes over time, suddenly or gradually. We describe, implement and validate an approach which allows us to incrementally learn a model whose complexity varies naturally in accordance with variation of scene appearance. It allows us to leverage the state of the art in pose estimation to build over many runs, a world model of sufficient richness to allow simple localisation despite a large variation in conditions. As our robot repeatedly traverses its workspace, it accumulates distinct visual experiences that in concert, implicitly represent the scene variation: each experience captures a visual mode. When operating in a previously visited area, we continually try to localise in these previous experiences while simultaneously running an independent vision-based pose estimation system. Failure to localise in a sufficient number of prior experiences indicates an insufficient model of the workspace and instigates the laying down of the live image sequence as a new distinct experience. In this way, over time we can capture the typical time-varying appearance of an environment and the number of experiences required tends to a constant. Although we focus on vision as a primary sensor throughout, the ideas we present here are equally applicable to other sensor modalities. We demonstrate our approach working on a road vehicle operating over a 3-month period at different times of day, in different weather and lighting conditions. We present extensive results analysing different aspects of the system and approach, in total processing over 136,000 frames captured from 37 km of driving.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel dataset captured from a VW station wagon for use in mobile robotics and autonomous driving research. In total, we recorded 6 hours of traffic scenarios at 10--Hz using a variety of sensor modalities such as high-resolution color and grayscale stereo cameras, a Velodyne 3D laser scanner and a high-precision GPS/IMU inertial navigation system. The scenarios are diverse, capturing real-world traffic situations, and range from freeways over rural areas to inner-city scenes with many static and dynamic objects. Our data is calibrated, synchronized and timestamped, and we provide the rectified and raw image sequences. Our dataset also contains object labels in the form of 3D tracklets, and we provide online benchmarks for stereo, optical flow, object detection and other tasks. This paper describes our recording platform, the data format and the utilities that we provide.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we provide a progress report of the LAAS-CNRS project of autonomous blimp robot development, in the context of field robotics. Hardware developments aimed at designing a generic and versatile experimental platform are first presented. On this base, the flight control and terrain mapping issues, which constitute the main thrust of the research work, are presented in two parts. The first part, devoted to the automatic control study, is based on a rigorous modeling of the airship dynamics. Considering the decoupling of the lateral and longitudinal dynamics, several flight phases are identified for which appropriate control strategies are proposed. The description focuses on the lateral steady navigation. In the second part of the paper, we present work on terrain mapping with lowaltitude stereovision. A simultaneous localization and map building approach based on an extended Kalman filter is depicted, with details on the identification of the various errors involved in the process. Experimental results show that positioning in the three-dimensional space with a centimeter accuracy can be achieved, thus allowing the possibility to build high-resolution digital elevation maps.},

  abstract       = {Long-term autonomous mobile robot operation requires considering place recognition decisions with great caution. A single incorrect decision that is not detected and reconsidered can corrupt the environment model that the robot is trying to build and maintain. This work describes a consensus-based approach to robust place recognition over time, that takes into account all the available information to detect and remove past incorrect loop closures. The main novelties of our work are: (1) the ability of realizing that, in light of new evidence, an incorrect past loop closing decision has been made; the incorrect information can be removed thus recovering the correct estimation with a novel algorithm; (2) extending our proposal to incremental operation; and (3) handling multi-session, spatially related or unrelated scenarios in a unified manner. We demonstrate our proposal, the RRR algorithm, on different odometry systems, e.g. visual or laser, using different front-end loop-closing techniques. For our experiments we use the efficient graph optimization framework g2o as back-end. We back our claims up with several experiments carried out on real data, in single and multi-session experiments showing better results than those obtained by state-of-the-art methods, comparisons against whom are also presented.},

  abstract = {We propose a non-iterative solution to the PnP problem---the estimation of the pose of a calibrated camera from n 3D-to-2D point correspondences---whose computational complexity grows linearly with n. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art methods that are O(n                        5) or even O(n                        8), without being more accurate. Our method is applicable for all n≥4 and handles properly both planar and non-planar configurations. Our central idea is to express the n 3D points as a weighted sum of four virtual control points. The problem then reduces to estimating the coordinates of these control points in the camera referential, which can be done in O(n) time by expressing these coordinates as weighted sum of the eigenvectors of a 12{\texttimes}12 matrix and solving a small constant number of quadratic equations to pick the right weights. Furthermore, if maximal precision is required, the output of the closed-form solution can be used to initialize a Gauss-Newton scheme, which improves accuracy with negligible amount of additional time. The advantages of our method are demonstrated by thorough testing on both synthetic and real-data.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we use the algorithm SeqSLAM to address the question, how little and what quality of visual information is needed to localize along a familiar route? We conduct a comprehensive investigation of place recognition performance on seven datasets while varying image resolution (primarily 1 to 512 pixel images), pixel bit depth, field of view, motion blur, image compression and matching sequence length. Results confirm that place recognition using single images or short image sequences is poor, but improves to match or exceed current benchmarks as the matching sequence length increases. We then present place recognition results from two experiments where low-quality imagery is directly caused by sensor limitations; in one, place recognition is achieved along an unlit mountain road by using noisy, long-exposure blurred images, and in the other, two single pixel light sensors are used to localize in an indoor environment. We also show failure modes caused by pose variance and sequence aliasing, and discuss ways in which they may be overcome. By showing how place recognition along a route is feasible even with severely degraded image sequences, we hope to provoke a re-examination of how we develop and test future localization and mapping systems.},

  abstract  = {Abstract The paper describes a visual method for the navigation of autonomous floor-cleaning robots. The method constructs a topological map with metrical information where place nodes are characterized by panoramic images and by particle clouds representing position estimates. Current image and position estimate of the robot are interrelated to landmark images and position estimates stored in the map nodes through a holistic visual homing method which provides bearing and orientation estimates. Based on these estimates, a position estimate of the robot is updated by a particle filter. The robot{\textquoteright}s position estimates are used to guide the robot along parallel, meandering lanes and are also assigned to newly created map nodes which later serve as landmarks. Computer simulations and robot experiments confirm that the robot position estimate obtained by this method is sufficiently accurate to keep the robot on parallel lanes, even in the presence of large random and systematic odometry errors. This ensures an efficient cleaning behavior with almost complete coverage of a rectangular area and only small repeated coverage. Furthermore, the topological-metrical map can be used to completely cover rooms or apartments by multiple meander parts.},

  abstract  = {The central challenge in robotic mapping is obtaining reliable data associations (or {\textquotedblleft}loop closures{\textquotedblright}): state-of-the-art inference algorithms can fail catastrophically if even one erroneous loop closure is incorporated into the map. Consequently, much work has been done to push error rates closer to zero. However, a long-lived or multi-robot system will still encounter errors, leading to system failure. We propose a fundamentally different approach: allow richer error models that allow the probability of a failure to be explicitly modeled. In other words, rather than characterizing loop closures as being {\textquotedblleft}right{\textquotedblright} or {\textquotedblleft}wrong{\textquotedblright}, we propose characterizing the error of those loop closures in a more expressive manner that can account for their non-Gaussian behavior. Our approach leads to an fully integrated Bayesian framework for dealing with error-prone data. Unlike earlier multiple-hypothesis approaches, our approach avoids exponential memory complexity and is fast enough for real-time performance. We show that the proposed method not only allows loop closing errors to be automatically identified, but also that in extreme cases, the {\textquotedblleft}front-end{\textquotedblright} loop-validation systems can be unnecessary. We demonstrate our system both on standard benchmarks and on the real-world data sets that motivated this work.},

  abstract  = {A reliable representation of the environment a robot operates in is vital for solving complex tasks. Models that represent information about objects and their properties are typically trained beforehand using supervised methods. This requires intensive human labeling which makes it time-consuming and results in models that are generally inflexible to changes. We would prefer a robot that can build a model of the environment autonomously by learning the different objects and their corresponding properties without human supervision. This would enable the robot to adapt to changes in the environment as well as reduce the effort of deploying a robot to a new environment. In this paper we present solutions to these problems based on novel extensions of affinity propagation; a clustering method that can be executed in real time to produce meaningful models from observations gathered by a robot. Our method is applied to two different tasks. We demonstrate how to automatically learn models for predicting collisions from raw laser data. Then, the method is used to learn visual appearance models of the environment to recognize and avoid obstacles. In both cases, there is no human supervision; the methodology is entirely based on sensory information gathered by the robot and its interaction with the environment. In experiments we show how meta-point affinity propagation performs similarly to standard affinity propagation, while being faster and capable of handling much larger data-sets. Furthermore, we show how different features influence the prediction quality of the model for collision prediction from laser scans. Finally, we show how we successfully build and maintain an appearance model for obstacle detection which can be used to detect obstacles well before a collision could occur.},

It is a step in the direction of life-long learning and adaptation and is motivated by the desire to build robots that have plastic competencies which are not baked in. They should react to and benefit from use. We consider a particular instantiation of this problem in the context of place recognition. Based on a topic-based probabilistic representation for images, we use a measure of perplexity to evaluate how well a working set of background images explain the robot{\textquoteright}s online view of the world. Offline, the robot then searches an external resource to seek out additional background images that bolster its ability to localize in its environment when used next. In this way the robot adapts and improves performance through use. We demonstrate this approach using data collected from a mobile robot operating in outdoor workspaces.},

  abstract  = {In order to enable long-term operation of autonomous vehicles in industrial environments numerous challenges need to be addressed. A basic requirement for many applications is the creation and maintenance of consistent 3D world models. This article proposes a novel 3D spatial representation for online real-world mapping, building upon two known representations: normal distributions transform (NDT) maps and occupancy grid maps. The proposed normal distributions transform occupancy map (NDT-OM) combines the advantages of both representations; compactness of NDT maps and robustness of occupancy maps. One key contribution in this article is that we formulate an exact recursive updates for NDT-OMs. We show that the recursive update equations provide natural support for multi-resolution maps. Next, we describe a modification of the recursive update equations that allows adaptation in dynamic environments. As a second key contribution we introduce NDT-OMs and formulate the occupancy update equations that allow to build consistent maps in dynamic environments. The update of the occupancy values are based on an efficient probabilistic sensor model that is specially formulated for NDT-OMs. In several experiments with a total of 17 hours of data from a milk factory we demonstrate that NDT-OMs enable real-time performance in large-scale, long-term industrial setups.},

  Abstract                 = {Mobile autonomous robots have finally emerged from the confined spaces of structured and controlled indoor environments. To fulfill the promises of ubiquitous robotics in unstructured outdoor environments, robust navigation is a key requirement. The research in the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) community has largely focused on optical sensors to solve this problem, and the fact that the robot is a physical entity has largely been ignored. In this paper, a hierarchical SLAM framework is proposed that takes the interaction of the robot with the environment into account. A sequential Monte Carlo filter is used to generate local map segments with a combination of visual and embodied data associations. Constraints between segments are used to generate globally consistent maps with a focus on suitability for navigation tasks. The proposed method is experimentally verified on two different outdoor robots. The results show that the approach is viable and that the rich modeling of the robot with its environment provides a new modality with the potential for improving existing visual methods and extending the availability of SLAM in domains where visual processing alone is not sufficient.},

The frames may be known only indirectly through a series of spatial relationships, each with its associated error, arising from diverse causes, including positioning errors, measurement errors, or tolerances in part dimensions. This estimation method can be used to answer such questions as whether a camera attached to a robot is likely to have a particular reference object in its field of view. The calculated estimates agree well with those from an independent Monte Carlo simulation. The method makes it possible to decide in advance whether an uncertain relationship is known accu rately enough for some task and, if not, how much of an improvement in locational knowledge a proposed sensor will provide. The method presented can be generalized to six degrees offreedom and provides a practical means of esti mating the relationships ( position and orientation) among objects, as well as estimating the uncertainty associated with the relationships.},

  abstract                   = {Infield environments it is often not possible to provide robot teams with detailed a priori environment and task models. In such unstructured environments, robots will need to create a dimensionally accurate three-dimensional geometric model of its surroundings by performing appropriate sensor actions. However, uncertainties in robot locations and sensing limitations/occlusions make this difficult. A new algorithm, based on iterative sensor planning and sensor redundancy, is proposed to build a geometrically consistent dimensional map of the environment for mobile robots that have articulated sensors. The aim is to acquire new information that leads to more detailed and complete knowledge of the environment. The robot(s) is controlled to maximize geometric knowledge gained of its environment using an evaluation function based on Shannon's information theory. Using the measured and Markovian predictions of the unknown environment, an information theory based metric is maximized to determine a robotic agent's next best view (NBV) of the environment. Data collected at this NB V pose are fused using a Kalman filter statistical uncertainty model to the measured environment map. The process continues until the environment mapping process is complete. The work is unique in the application of information theory to enhance the performance of environment sensing robot agents. It may be used by multiple distributed and decentralized sensing agents for efficient and accurate cooperative environment modeling. The algorithm makes no assumptions of the environment structure. Hence, it is robust to robot failure since the environment model being built is not dependent on any single agent frame, but is set in an absolute reference frame. It accounts for sensing uncertainty, robot motion uncertainty, environment model uncertainty and other critical parameters. It allows for regions of higher interest receiving greater attention by the agents. This algorithm is particularly well suited to unstructured environments, where sensor uncertainty and occlusions are significant. Simulations and experiments show the effectiveness of this algorithm.},

It transforms the SLAM posterior into a graphical network, representing the log-likelihood of the data. It then reduces this graph using variable elimination techniques, arriving at a lower-dimensional problems that is then solved using conventional optimization techniques. As a result, GraphSLAM can generate maps with 108 or more features. The paper discusses a greedy algorithm for data association, and presents results for SLAM in urban environments with occasional GPS measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {Robot localization systems typically assume that the environment is static, ignoring the dynamics inherent in most real-world settings. Corresponding scenarios include households, offices, warehouses and parking lots, where the location of certain objects such as goods, furniture or cars can change over time. These changes typically lead to inconsistent observations with respect to previously learned maps and thus decrease the localization accuracy or even prevent the robot from globally localizing itself. In this paper we present a sound probabilistic approach to lifelong localization in changing environments using a combination of a Rao-Blackwellized particle filter with a hidden Markov model. By exploiting several properties of this model, we obtain a highly efficient map management approach for dynamic environments, which makes it feasible to run our algorithm online. Extensive experiments with a real robot in a dynamically changing environment demonstrate that our algorithm reliably adapts to changes in the environment and also outperforms the popular Monte-Carlo localization approach.},

  Abstract                 = {{In this paper the metric and topological paradigms are integrated in a hybrid system for both localization and map building. A global topological map connects local metric maps, allowing a compact environment model, which does not require global metric consistency and permits both precision and robustness. Furthermore, the approach handles loops in the environment during automatic mapping by means of the information of the multimodal topological localization. The system uses a 360degrees laser scanner to extract corners and openings for the topological approach and lines for the metric method. This hybrid approach has been tested in a 50 m x 25 m portion of the institute building with the fully autonomous robot Donald Duck. Experiments are of four types: maps created by a complete exploration of the environment are compared to estimate their quality; test missions are randomly generated in order to evaluate the efficiency of the approach for both the localization and relocation; the fourth type of experiments shows the practicability of the approach for closing the loop.

By recursive learning of GMM, the components corresponding to the static objects will have larger weights while the components corresponding to the moving objects will have smaller weights. At each time step, a number of components with the largest weights are adaptively selected as the background map and the new observations which do not match with the background map are classified as the foreground map. In addition, based on a Bayesian factorisation of simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) problem, we present an online algorithm for SLAM with GMM learning. Our contributions are employing GMM learning approach to model the dynamic environment with detection of moving objects and jointing the GMM learning with SLAM in unknown environment. Consequently, an online approach for mapping with a mobile robot in dynamic and unknown environments is presented. Some simulation results indicate that our approach is feasible.},

Furthermore, it is proven that this optimization problem has at most two minima. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of one or two minima are derived in a form that can be easily evaluated using observation and odometry data. It is demonstrated that more than one minimum exists only when the observation and odometry data are extremely inconsistent with each other. A numerical algorithm based on bisection is proposed for solving the one-dimensional nonlinear optimization problem. It is shown that the approach extends to joining of two maps, thus can be used to obtain an approximate solution to the complete \{SLAM\} problem through map joining.},

However, the SURF method is not originally designed for applications in dynamic environments. The repeatability of the detected SURFs will be reduced owing to the dynamic effect. This study investigated and modified SURF algorithms to improve robustness in representing visual landmarks in robot SLAM systems. Many modifications of the SURF algorithms are proposed in this study including the orientation representation of features, the vector dimension of feature description, and the number of detected features in an image. The concept of sparse representation is also used to describe the environmental map and to reduce the computational complexity when using extended Kalman filter (EKF) for state estimation. Effective procedures of data association and map management for SURFs in SLAM are also designed to improve accuracy in robot state estimation. Experimental works were performed on an actual system with binocular vision sensors to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The experimental examples include the evaluation of state estimation using EKF SLAM and the implementation of indoor SLAM. In the experiments, the performance of the modified SURF algorithms was compared with the original SURF algorithms. The experimental results confirm that the modified SURF provides better repeatability and better robustness for representing the landmarks in visual SLAM systems.},

Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas.},

  abstract = {Precise and robust localization is a significant task for autonomous vehicles in complex scenarios. The accurate position of autonomous vehicles is necessary for decision making and path planning. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to precisely locate the autonomous vehicle using a 3D-LIDAR sensor. First, a curb detection algorithm is performed. Next, a beam model is utilized to extract the contour of the multi-frame curbs. Then, the iterative closest point algorithm and two Kalman filters are employed to estimate the position of autonomous vehicles based on the high-precision map. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.},
